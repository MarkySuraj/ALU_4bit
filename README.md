# 4-bit ALU Design using Cadence Virtuoso

This project presents the design and verification of a **4-bit Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)** using **Cadence Virtuoso**. The ALU supports 8 fundamental operations and is implemented at the transistor level using **CMOS logic**.

---

## üß† Project Overview

The ALU is designed to perform **arithmetic and logic operations** on two 4-bit input operands. Each operation is selected using a 3-bit select line through an 8:1 multiplexer-based control structure.

| 101                      | 2's Complement | 2's complement of input A        |
| 110                      | CLEAR          | All outputs set to 0             |
| 111                      | INVERT         | Bitwise NOT of input A           |

## üß± Design Flow

1. **CMOS-Level Circuit Design**:
   - Designed each logic block (AND, OR, XOR, etc.) using CMOS gates.
   - Arithmetic operations (ADD, 2's complement) built using:
     - Mirror Adder (for full adder logic)
     - 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)

2. **Schematic Creation**:
   - Created individual schematic files for each operation.
   - Combined symbols using hierarchical design in Virtuoso.

3. **Symbol Creation**:
   - Generated symbols for each block for modular connection.

4. **Testbench Design**:
   - Designed a testbench schematic with input pins, VDD, and select lines.
   - Used `vpulse` and `vdc` sources to simulate input patterns.

5. **Simulation & Verification**:
   - Verified waveform outputs using **Cadence Virtuoso Spectre simulator**.
   - Checked functional correctness for each operation via transient analysis.
